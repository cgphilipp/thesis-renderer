# Thesis renderer 

In this repository I am presenting the result of my masters thesis
"Design and Implementation of a Physically-Based Renderer using Multi-Frame Sampling".

**Note** The original implementation happened in the repository [webgl-operate](https://github.com/cginternals/webgl-operate) using npm + typescript + WebGL.
The files checked in here are merely an export of the build for easy hosting on my part.

If you want to dive into the implementation see [the progressive lighting demo in webgl-operate](https://github.com/cginternals/webgl-operate/tree/master/demos/progressive-lighting).
